These will be our instructions to the prof of how to use our program.
This requires two terminals to be open.
One terminal functions as the website you are logging in to.
The other terminal represents what would be your phone authenticator.
To use the code you first run the AuthenticatorApp.
This file asks you to enter your username and gives you a one time passcode.
You then run the AuthenticatorServer program which asks you to input your username and the given passcode.
If both are right the program tells you that you have successfully logged in.
If either is wrong the program tells you that you have incorrect credentials and asks if you would like to try again.
